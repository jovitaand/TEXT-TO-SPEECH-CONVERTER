# TEXT-TO-SPEECH-CONVERTER

## Project Overview

This project is a cloud-based text-to-speech (TTS) converter application designed to generate high-quality, natural-sounding audio from text input. By leveraging AWS services, it provides a scalable, reliable, and serverless solution for users who require audio versions of written text for accessibility, content creation, and educational purposes.

## Project Goals

- **On-Demand Conversion**: Convert text to speech with minimal latency.
- **Scalable Architecture**: Utilize serverless infrastructure to support varying loads.
- **Accessible API**: Provide easy access via a simple API endpoint for seamless user interaction.

## Key AWS Services

- **AWS Lambda**: The serverless compute layer that initiates the TTS process without the need for server management. It ensures cost-effective scaling based on usage.
- **AWS Polly**: Processes text input and generates audio output in a variety of natural-sounding voices and languages, allowing for customization based on user needs.
- **AWS S3 (optional)**: Used for storing generated audio files for persistent access.
- **AWS API Gateway (optional)**: Exposes the Lambda function as a public-facing API endpoint, allowing external users to interact with the service.

## Solution Architecture

1. **Request Flow**:
   - User sends text input via a web or mobile interface to the API Gateway endpoint.
   - API Gateway forwards the request to AWS Lambda.
   - Lambda triggers AWS Polly, converting the text input into an audio stream.
   - The audio stream is either returned immediately to the user or saved in S3 for later access.

2. **Scalability**:
   - AWS Lambda automatically scales to handle concurrent requests based on demand.
   - AWS Polly supports multiple requests and offers different voice and language options.

3. **Data Security**:
   - Access to AWS resources is managed with IAM roles and policies.
   - Optional encryption for S3 storage to secure audio files if long-term storage is enabled.

## Tools and Resources

- **IDE**: Visual Studio Code for local development.
- **AWS SDK for Python (Boto3)**: Used within Lambda to interface with AWS services programmatically.
